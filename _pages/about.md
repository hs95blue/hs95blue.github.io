Hi, My name is Hyunsik Lee. I graduated from Hongik University's Software Convergence Department, and I am currently working as a Java developer in a small business. I'm mainly trying to cover the Spring Framework, and I'm also interested in algorithms and data analysis. As a developer, this is the first step to start so stay tuned.
